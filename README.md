lcd and i2c_lcd
===============

Python code for talking to character based LCDs.

The I2c_Lcd class allows for talking to i2c based LCDs.

This was tested on a BeagleBone Black using a 2 x 16 LCD with an i2c
module similar to this one:

This code was adapted from some C code that I had written previously for
the AVR.
